    "**Breast cancer** is a disease involving uncontrolled proliferation of cells resulting from DNA mutations acquired throughout a person’s lifetime. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer, as well as one of the top-leading causes of death that are cancer-related. In 2026, an estimated 300,000+ cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed, roughly translating to 1 in 8 women in the United States.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Gene expression profiling is a method that aims to distinguish cancerous from normal samples by analyzing individual, unique “molecular signatures” — specific patterns of genes that are switched on or off in cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue. In our question, we want to narrow down which genes contribute the most to specific types of breast cancer. Each subtype of breast cancer primarily differs by the presence or absence of hormone receptors. These markers allow us to categorize tumors into four main molecular subtypes: Basal-like, HER2-enriched, Luminal A, and Luminal B. These four comprise our Kaggle dataset with the exception of cell_line breast cancer, which are immortalized in vitro models used in research whereas the 4 main subtypes are clinical, patient-derivived classifications. Our analysis will only focus on the 4 main previously mentioned. \n",
    "\n",
    "After doing research on known information about what gene mutations cause/significantly increase the risk of developing breast cancer, we were able to narrow down hypotheses for each subtype of breast cancer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has explored a similar aspect in a published NlH article titled “Identification of breast cancer subtypes and drug response prediction through forward and reverse translation”.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) In this study, they predicted subtype-specific therapeutic drug response by connecting patient tumor data with cancer screening data. This group trained NMF-based models on DepMap cell-line data in order to predict CDK4 vs CDK6 (classes of medicine used in combination with hormone therapy) dependency from gene expression and applied those models to TCGA tumors. Results from this test suggested that Luminal A was mostly skewed towards a CDK4 dependency, while Luminal B had a skewed CDK6 dependency. Additionally, some subtypes showed more hormone expression than others, such as those with higher estrogen-driven expression, and others with high cell-cycle programs. The core differences between this experimental model and our project is that they were more focused on using patterns across thousands of genes to discover and describe subgroups, whereas we want to determine which specific genes are the root that cause breast cancer subgroups to be expressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another study published in Science Direct takes a more similar approach to our project than the last, but focusing on using feature selection strategies to “identify statistically significant genes and accurately classify cancer types from RNA-seq data”.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-3) Essentially, this project aims to create a masterlist of what specific genes are found in cancer tumor tissue. This study is more similar to our project, but instead is interested in a general view of cancer types, rather than solely narrowing in on breast cancer. Our project wants to create a link between named genes and a specific subgroup of breast cancer, rather than cancer as a whole. In the analysis, they utilized Ridge Regression and Lasso algorithms to find the best features from the data. With Ridge Regression, this method helped to identify dominant genes among their 800+ cancer tissue sample set (bound to have a lot of noise). It is a well suited statistical method for high-dimensional genomic datasets. In contrast, Lasso serves as a regularization technique and is particularly useful when only a subset of features are informative. The results of this study created a refined list of the top ~100 genes that were associated with various tumor types. Furthermore, they were able to find the highest vs lowest expression of the top 50 genes with a distinction by color, expanding their conclusion to also consider co-expressed genes and condition-specific patterns.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-3) \n",

    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our research question, the ideal dataset would be one that consists of gene expression profiles from tumor samples with cancer subtype labels clearly defined. The primary variables would include normalized gene expression measurements for a large number of genes per sample, with a categorical variable indicating the cancer subtype (ie. Luminal A, Luminal B, Basal, etc). These gene expression features can act as the input to a classification model, while the subtype labels can act as the target variable. Preferably, data related to the patient, such as age or tumor characteristics, would be included as control variables to account for the potential source of biological variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the dataset would include tumor samples/observations ranging from several hundred to a few thousand, with reasonably balanced representation for each subtype to ensure that our model has enough statistical power and has stable performance. When it comes to data collection, these data would usually be collected from tumor biopsy samples from cancer patients in clinical or research facilities. Gene expression level would be measured using standardized genomic profiling techniques such as microarray analysis or RNA sequencing. Cancer subtype labels would be assigned based on established clinical or molecular classification criteria, and all samples would undergo consistent preprocessing and normalization to ensure data are comparable across observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the data would be stored in a structured table format where each row represents an individual tumor sample, and each column represents a gene expression value or relevant clinical or demographic variables such as age and tumor characteristics mentioned above, with subtype labels stored as a separate target variable. Gene identifiers would also be standardized, and the dataset would be organized in ways to support machine learning workflow, such as feature selection, model training, and interpretation of gene importance scores.\n",

There is also a categorical variable indicating the cancer subtype or class for each sample.
