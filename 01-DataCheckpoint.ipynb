    "Breast cancer is a disease involving uncontrolled proliferation of cells resulting from DNA mutations acquired throughout a person’s lifetime. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer, as well as one of the leading causes of death that is cancer-related. In 2026, an estimated 300,000+ cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed, roughly translating to 1 in 8 women in the United States <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). One important thing to be aware of is that breast cancer isn’t one single disease. Tumors biologically are very different, which makes labeling them in subtypes a very useful labeling method. Gene expression profiling is a method that aims to distinguish cancerous from normal samples by analyzing individual, unique “molecular signatures” — specific patterns of genes that are switched on or off in cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue. In our question, we want to narrow down which genes contribute the most to specific types of breast cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each subtype of breast cancer primarily differs by the presence or absence of hormone receptors. These markers allow us to categorize tumors into four main molecular subtypes: Basal-like, HER2-enriched, Luminal A, and Luminal B. These four comprise our Kaggle dataset, and will be the types that we focus on within our analysis. In the clinic, each subtype is usually approximated using pathology tests – mainly: PR (progesterone receptor), ER (estrogen receptor), HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), and other markers such as the nuclear protein Ki-67 (a familiar biomarker for cellular proliferation). As for the subtypes previously mentioned, they differ by a few main factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Luminal A: Very hormone-driven with a lower proliferation rate. The typical receptors found are ER/PR+, HER2-, and low Ki-67. These factors indicate it is slower-growing and responds well to the hormone endocrine.\n",
    "- Luminal B: Very hormone-driven; however, a higher proliferation rate than Luminal A. The typical receptors found are ER/PR+ (lower PR in comparison), and HER2 either +/-. These factors indicate more severity than Luminal A, and might need chemotherapy in addition to hormone therapy because it is less response to solely endocrine-based treatment \n",
    "- HER2-enriched: Driven primarily by the HER2 pathway, often HER2+, and is faster-growing and has a higher rate than Luminal A/B. Outcomes would improve with HER2-targeted treatments\n",
    "- Basal-like: Triple negative with the common receptors ER/PR/HER2. Relies heavily on chemotherapy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The +/- sign following a receptor indicates the state of expression of that receptor for a certain tumor. For example, + means meaningful expression and that the receptor is turned on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing the subtypes of cancer is critical in developing a treatment plan because it alters which hormone therapy should be applied to a patient. In HR+ circumstances, endocrine therapies are critical, whereas in HER2-driven cases, HER2-targeted drugs are of more importance. Furthermore, it changes the prognosis and recurrence pattern of a patient, since certain tumors have more favorable outlooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "After researching known information about what gene mutations cause/significantly increase the risk of developing breast cancer, we were able to narrow down hypotheses for each subtype of breast cancer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has explored a similar aspect in a published NlH article titled “Identification of breast cancer subtypes and drug response prediction through forward and reverse translation” <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). In this study, they predicted subtype-specific therapeutic drug response by connecting patient tumor data with cancer screening data. This group trained NMF-based models on DepMap cell-line data in order to predict CDK4 vs CDK6 (classes of medicine used in combination with hormone therapy) dependency from gene expression and applied those models to TCGA tumors. Results from this test suggested that Luminal A was mostly skewed towards a CDK4 dependency, while Luminal B had a skewed CDK6 dependency. Additionally, some subtypes showed more hormone expression than others, such as those with higher estrogen-driven expression, and others with high cell-cycle programs. The core differences between this experimental model and our project are that they were more focused on using patterns across thousands of genes to discover and describe subgroups, whereas we want to determine which specific genes are the root cause of breast cancer subgroups to be expressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another study published in Science Direct takes a more similar approach to our project than the last, but focusing on using feature selection strategies to “identify statistically significant genes and accurately classify cancer types from RNA-seq data” <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Essentially, this project aims to create a masterlist of what specific genes are found in cancer tumor tissue. This study is more similar to our project, but instead interested in a general view of cancer types, rather than solely focusing on breast cancer. Our project wants to create a link between named genes and a specific subgroup of breast cancer, rather than cancer as a whole. In the analysis, they utilized Ridge Regression and Lasso algorithms to find the best features from the data. With Ridge Regression, this method helped to identify dominant genes among their 800+ cancer tissue sample set (bound to have a lot of noise). It is a well-suited statistical method for high-dimensional genomic datasets. In contrast, Lasso serves as a regularization technique and is particularly useful when only a subset of features are informative. The results of this study created a refined list of the top ~100 genes that were associated with various tumor types. Furthermore, they were able to find the highest vs lowest expression of the top 50 genes with a distinction by color, expanding their conclusion to also consider co-expressed genes and condition-specific patterns <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). \n",

    "We predict that Basal-like tumors will show higher KRT5 and KRT14 expression, quantified by a larger mean standardized expression (z-score) for KRT5/KRT14 in Basal-like samples compared to the other three subtypes, and that these genes will rank highly by model feature importance (e.g., large one-vs-rest coefficients on Logistic Regression Classification task, higher accuracy/F1 compared to other choices of genes). Likewise, we expect HER2-enriched to be driven by higher ERBB2/GRB7, Luminal A by higher ESR1/PGR with relatively low ERBB2, and Luminal B by higher ESR1 plus higher MKI67 than Luminal A. This is because the subtypes reflect differences in basal markers, HER2 signaling, hormone signaling, and proliferation."

    "\n",
    "#### Dataset #1\n",
    "Dataset Name: Breast cancer gene expression - CuMiDa\n",
    "- Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brunogrisci/breast-cancer-gene-expression-cumida\n",
    "- Number of observations: 151 observations\n",
    "- Number of variables: 54, 677 variables\n",
    "- Description of the variables most relevant to this project: The most relevant variables include the normalized gene expression measurement and the breast cancer subtype label. The gene expression variables (Affymetrix ID) are continuous numerical features that represent the expression level of thousands of genes for each tumor sample. These will serve as the predictor variables in our classification model. The breast cancer subtype label is categorical and used to identify whether each sample is Basal-like, HER, Luminal A, or Luminal B, and acts as the response variable in our model. By combining these variables, they will allow us to train models and evaluate which specific genes contribute most to distinguishing between breast cancer subtypes.\n",
    "- Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project: While the dataset is well-suited to our research question, it does present a few manageable limitations. To begin, the dataset contains a very large number of gene expression variables relative to the 151 samples, which means careful feature selection and model validation will be important to us to avoid overfitting. Additionally, the sample size is moderate, so we should keep in mind that the resulting findings should be interpreted as exploratory rather than definitive. There may also be some imbalance across subtype categories, which we can address by evaluating metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score rather than relying solely on accuracy. The dataset also does not include demographic or clinical variables, so our analysis will focus strictly on molecular gene expression patterns rather than broader patient-level factors.\n",

    "Dataset Name: GPL570 Annotation Table\n",
    "- Link to the dataset: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL570 \n",
    "- Number of observations: 54, 675 observations\n",
    "- Number of variables: 16\n",
    "- Description of the variables most relevant to this project: The two variables most relevant to this project are ID and Gene Symbol. The ID variable serves as the unique identifier for each row in the annotation table. Each ID is formatted as a string, representing an internal code made by the company Affymetrix. The second variable, Gene Symbol, is a human-readable name for the gene that each row refers to, such as “DDR1”, “RFC2”, and “HSPA6”. These Gene Symbols are formatted as strings and are the generic shorthands of the genes developed by scientists over time. The ID is going to be used as a key to retrieve the Gene Symbol, which will give our conclusion meaning, tying certain genes to certain subtypes of breast cancer.\n",
    "- Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project: A majority of the variables in this dataset are unnecessary for our project. We’re only using this dataset to convert the IDs in the Kaggle dataset to their respective gene symbol counterpart in order to give an accurate conclusion as to what genes have the most impact on a model classifying breast cancer. It is also worth noting that some rows contain multiple genes separated by “///”, meaning a single probe ID corresponds to more than one gene. This introduces some ambiguity, as it might be difficult to determine which of these genes is the most relevant.\n"

    "### Breast cancer gene expression - CuMiDa Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "CuMiDa Dataset is a curated breast cancer expression dataset from CuMiDa that contains normalized gene expression measurements across tumor samples, along with a categorical subtype label for each sample. Each row represents a single tumor sample, and the gene expression columns represent measured expression for thousands of genes/probes. These gene expression features are the input to a classification model, while the subtype label is the target output. The key metric in this dataset is the gene expression level that was reported as normalized microarray expression values. A larger value for a gene means that the gene’s mRNA signal is more strongly expressed in that tumor sample relative to genes with lower values, indicating greater transcriptional activity after normalization to make samples comparable and suggesting that the gene may be more biologically active and potentially playing a more significant role in that tumor’s molecular profile. However, a gene can be important for classification, whether it is consistently higher or lower across specific subtypes, as long as it shows systematic differences between groups. The other key metric is the subtype label, which is a categorical variable (ie, Basal-like, HER, Luminal A, Luminal B) used to evaluate how well a model can distinguish breast cancer subtypes based on expression patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few concerns to pay attention to. First, the dataset has 151 samples from a single GEO series (GSE45827) curated by CuMiDa, which may limit how broadly the result can be generalized to the overall breast cancer population. In addition, the dataset may have unequal sample sizes across subtypes, which can bias a model toward better performance on the larger classes. Finally, because the dataset is anonymized and doesn't include demographic or clinical background information, we can't check whether findings generalize equally across different patient groups, so the conclusion should be framed as exploratory and focused on molecular patterns.\n",

    "### GPL570 Annotation Table\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPL570 annotation dataset does not contain numerical measurements or clinical values in the traditional medical sense, and therefore does not have units or thresholds in the way that a dataset of medical measurements would. Instead, the two variables most relevant to this project (ID and Gene Symbol) are categorical in nature. The probe ID is formatted as a string and serves as a reference code with no inherent meaning. The Gene Symbol is also text-based, containing shorthand names for human genes such as “DDR1”. These 2 variables serve as a lookup table, allowing probe IDs from the Kaggle breast cancer dataset to be translated into recognizable gene names, giving our conclusions more value by tying actual genes to their impact on breast cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary concern with this dataset is that it is being used solely as a lookup table to translate probe set IDs from the Kaggle breast cancer dataset into their corresponding gene symbols, meaning much of the dataset will go unused. Additionally, some probe sets map to multiple gene symbols separated by “///”, which may introduce ambiguity when trying to identify which specific genes are most influential in classifying breast cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also plan to merge this dataset with our CuMiDa dataset via joining the column names in CuMiDa with the ID column of this dataset, to obtain more informative feature labels and map each of what the genes themselves *actually* are, to the gene expression.\n",
    "\n",
